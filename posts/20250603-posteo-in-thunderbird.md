use the thunderbird automatic server setup tool if you wish, but some server settings will have to be changed to make it work:

- email address domain: as it appears in the alias you wish to primarily use - `posteo.ORG`, for instance
- server name: `posteo.DE`
- server name: `user@posteo.NET` (regardless of whether this is a set-up email alias)

these settings should be applied to both IMAP and SMTP. **all caps are for emphasis only**
