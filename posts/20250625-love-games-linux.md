title: running LÖVE games on linux
----

any (windows, for instance) game using the “Löve” 2d game engine (for instance, Balatro) can be run natively on linux by:

- downloading the `.AppImage` from <https://love2d.org>, putting it into the game directory, and `chmod`ding it
- running the `.AppImage` with the windows executable as its first argument
